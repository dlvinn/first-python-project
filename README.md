notes of this video about giving a pdf file and converting it to a audio file mp3 

python python3 -m venv .venv //create a virtual inviroment

python python3 source .venv/bin/activate //this does not work

venv\Scripts\activate   //this one id for activating the virtual inviroment

pyttsx3, PyPDF2         //you need to install these two libraries

inside of the inviroment install them this way:

python -m pip install pyttsx3   //so this is a text to speech conversion library

python -m pip install PyPDF2   //this is a python library used for performing major tasks on pdf files

also any pdf you want to convert to an audio put it to your project directory
